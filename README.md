# Ode To Solitudes 
I have made this project to give my gratitute to a specific music brand (New Age) who has helped me a lot focusing on my study- and relaxtion times for over a decade.

This website has been created to present the Solitudes brand back the world, as it seems it does not possess an own website (anymore). In this era of high pressure, stress and everything in high speed it's important to take time for yourself
and relax! Music is still one of the best remedies to get yourself back on a better paced track. On this website, you will find some background stories about Solitudes and it's creator. To enhance the exprience of Solitudes, a movie and some
audio are added for further enjoyment. You will also find a timeline of important achievements and a link to a complete list of the discography (new data can always be added!). More information about commonly used sounds of Solitudes' favourite 
animals and areas can also be found. At the bottom of the page, you will find option for users to get subscribed to the newsletter and check out social links to Solitudes social networks.

## Example
An example of the website can be found [here](https://eucaa.github.io/Solitudes/)._
Please do not hesitate to contact website creator [eucaa](info@eucaa.com) for questions, information or bugs you would like to report.

## UX
My aim for this website is to breath some new life into this brand and it's music. Since Solitudes' music started in flourishment in the '80's and '90's, I wanted to give it a feel of from these era's but also but it a more modern edge to
make more interesting for younger generations. I've kept the website in natural color shades to give it a friendly welcoming and calm apperance. The original brand logo is used to stay close to it's origin.

A gentle moving nature-gif was added to the main background to give it a more alive and interactive feeling. Aside for this, some music fragments are added to enjoy and promote Solitudes' music.
The video- screen border as been adjusted so it feels as if "you are looking through a window, to the outside world".

A [link](https://solitudes-eucaa.c9users.io/solitudes-disco-list.pdf) is added to the complete discography of Solitudes, which will open in a new tab.

Wireframes, and all used music- and video content, images and additional files can be found in the assets-folder.

## Technologies
I thankfully made use of the following programming tools
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap (4.0)_
And a dash of JavaScript.

## Features
There are many features added to this website to make it as responcive as possible, so it's also easier to access for the elderly. The main features are:
- Removed standard border to widen the range between text areas and for better alignment.
- Added multiple layers of tranparency for a more gentle and interactive feel.
- Took out the video for better responciveness and faster page loading on devices whom are smaller that a width of 769.
- Added collapsed navbar for iPad size to prevent it from cluttering.
- Removed the auto-"download" option from all audio-tags to prevent illegal download and spreading.
- Adjusted frame sizes and frame border to give it viewing box feeling.
- A complete discography provided by visiting an external [link](https://solitudes-eucaa.c9users.io/solitudes-disco-list.pdf).

## Features for the future
- Updating discography list
- Adding a section for new music publications (On the webpage as in the newsletter)
- Changing logo color of the brand image on the home page depending on the season 

## JQuery
The website uses some JQuery for extra flow.
